# Git Commit Restrictions

- **NEVER** run `git commit` or `git push` without explicit user permission.
- When changes are ready to commit, show the user the `git status` and proposed commit message, then **ask for approval** before executing.
- Never use `--trailer` in git commits.
- Never set the author to "Cursor", "Cursor Agent", or any AI/agent identity.
