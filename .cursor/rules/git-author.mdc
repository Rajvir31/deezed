# Git commit author

- When making git commits in this repo, **never** set the author to "Cursor", "Cursor Agent", or any AI/agent identity.
- Use the repository's configured git user (run `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` in the repo). Do not pass `--author` unless it is to correct a commit to the repo owner's name and email.
- Commits should be attributed to the human owner of the repo so they do not show up as a separate contributor.
